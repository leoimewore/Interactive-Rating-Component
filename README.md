# Interactive-Rating-Component
My First JS+HTML+CSS Project


This is the first time i am creating a js script for my web development project. I recently started studying the fundamentals of JavaScript: data types, structures and algorithms. 
In the course of my study i have covered DOM manipulations using methods like querySelectors and addEventlistner and sure i developed my first JS page. ðŸ˜€


THOUGHT PROCESS 

I started off with a frontend mentor project which involve designing and interactive platform where a users submits a rating by clicking a button and gets realtime feedback

CSS: Made use of Flexbox and multiple typography styles and the z index 

JS: Applied DOM methods and used fundamentals like a for loop to iterate the list items, assigned variables and created js functions in the event listener. 


Super excited about this and i am excited to learn more about using JS in Front end development
